Step 1 : Add the files server.js, package.json and dbMessages.js to a different folder named whatsapp-backend at the level of whatsapp-mern.
Step 2 : run "npm install" in the directory to get the dependencies installed.
Step 3 : You should have a mongoDb atlas account where should create a cluster(it's free !)
Step 4 : From the cluster grab the connection string and paste in connection_url inside server.js.
Step 5 : Also you should have a pusher account for making MongoDB act real time(it's free!!)
Step 6 : Run nodemon server.js to get the backend running.
Step 7 : After configuring backend just run "npm install" in the whatsapp-mern folder and run npm start to get the frontend running.



Happy Coding!!
